My name is Ryan Smith, and I am a postgraduate student in the University of Glasgow's
[Institute of Neuroscience and Psychology](http://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/neurosciencepsychology/). There, 
I am currently working with [Dr. Maxine Swingler](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/psychology/staff/maxineswingler/) investigating the mental representation of food in stored eating simulations, and how these simulations influence the motivation to consume different types of food.
